## Context

Write the Docs is the largest conference for technical writers. Every year, dozens of writers share their knowledge in conference talks. These talks are then uploaded to YouTube.

## Goal

Make it easier to consume all of the information.

## Method

Use AI to convert all of the conference talks into easily readable documents that can be consumed in a variety of formats, such as via the web or on an e-reader.

## Process

a couple of tools from [OpenAI](#) have made this particularly straightforward:

- Whisper - a tool for generating transcriptions from audio
- GPT-3 - a tool that can summarize text and rewrite transcriptions into a more readable format
